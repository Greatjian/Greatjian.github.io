## EXPERIENCE

- High throughput smoothing of Raman images for studying lithium negative electrode, Aug 2017 – Present

    Columbia University (with Prof. Yuan Yang), New York, USA
    
    - Implemented Gaussian kernel smoothing regression to achieve smoothing of Raman images using MATLAB
    - Removed the noise and improved visual recognition of Ramen images by 30%

- Web crawling for technology news gathering and processing, May 2017 – Aug 2017
    
    BICI USA, California, USA

    - Designed a web scraper using Python to search news articles on technology websites
    - Implemented with Requests, BeautifulSoup, nltk, PostgreSQL and uploaded work on AWS EC2
    - Highly improved the efficiency of finding potential investment opportunities compared to manual searching

- Excimer laser-induced crystallization (ELC) of amorphous Si films, Feb 2017 – May 2017

    Columbia University (with Prof. James Im), New York, USA

    - Conducted numerical analysis on the model of melting and solidification process in the pulsed laser irradiation of thin semiconductor films using Python
    - Implemented data processing for status and temperature of the sample grid, making plot for direct visualization

## PROJECTS

- Q-Learning self-driving car
    - Used Pytorch as deep learning framework and Kivy as car simulation generator to build an AI for a self-driving car model in Python
    - Applied Deep Q-Learning model and Softmax function to achieve self-learning and action selection

- Breakout AI
    - Used Pytorch-a3c as deep reinforcement learning framework and OpenCV as computer vision platform to build an AI to play Breakout games.
    - Applied A3C model and Long Short-Term Memory for better deep reinforcement learning performances

- 2-Do List app
    - Developed an Android To-Do List application using Java and the Android Studio
    - Worked with Gson and Android SDK APIs such as Adapter, ListView; visualized on Android Virtual Device emulator
